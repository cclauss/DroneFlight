# DroneFlight

My main target here is to provide an appropriate visualization of drone's path and the Lidar data. I will here show each sweep of data in isolation as well as all the sweeps combined together. Also another target is to find a better flight path that will result in the shortest possible time but still goes through the existing rooms based on the provided data.
